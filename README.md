# RISC-V based MYTH + Design Project Workshop
This is a workshop organized by [VLSI System Design](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/riscv-based-myth/) with the objective of providing a solid introduction to RISC-V and steps needed to create your own pipelined microprocessor. The tools used are the terminal, GCC and [Makerchip](https://myth.makerchip.com/), developed by [Redwood EDA](https://www.redwoodeda.com/).

## Day 1 - RISC-V ISA and GNU compiler toolchain

Topics discussed:
- Software to hardware introduction
- Description of application binary interface (ABI) and how the operating system communicates with hardware
- ISA, types of instructions
